deprecations:
  - |
    Version 2.1.0 of oslo.cache swithed from python-memcached to pymemcache,
    we still maintain a backward compatibility matrix between arguments
    consumed by these libraries, but python-memcached compat will be
    dropped in future cycle.

    All these arguments will be fully ignored, `debug`, `pload`, `pid`
    `server_max_key_length`, `server_max_value_length`, `flush_on_reconnect`
    `cache_cas`, `check_keys`

    All these arguments are in the compatibility matrix but will be
    removed soon, `pickleProtocol`, `pickler`, `unpickler`, `dead_retry`
    `socket_timeout`
fixes:
  - |
    Some clients gives arguments that correspond to the python-memcached
    library, we need to support them by introducing a mapping maintained
    during some period to avoid possible issues_ and allow user to migrate
    to the right arguments.
